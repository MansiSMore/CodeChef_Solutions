Finally a monsoon has come. According to the Meteorological Department, there will be rain in the upcoming N days in the city. 
Initially, the water level of the city is zero millimetres. The amount of rain on the i-th day can be described by an integer Ai as follows:
If Ai>0, the water level of the city increases by Ai millimetres on the i-th day.
If Ai=0, there is no rain on the i-th day. The water level of the city decreases by D millimetres on such a day. 
However, if the water level is less than D millimetres before the i-th day, then it becomes zero instead.
There will be a red alert in the city if the water level becomes strictly greater than H millimetres on at least one of the N days. 
Determine if there will be a red alert.

Input Format :
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, D and H.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format :
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if there will be a red alert or "NO" otherwise.

Constraints :
1≤T≤103
1≤N,D≤102
0≤Ai≤102 for each valid i
1≤H≤104

Subtasks :
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

Sample Input 1 :
4
4 2 6
1 3 0 2
2 1 100
1 100
4 2 3
1 2 0 2
3 7 10
5 3 9 

Sample Output 1 :
NO
YES
NO
YES

Explanation :
Example case 1:
On the first day, the water level of the city increases to 1 millimtre.
On the second day, the water level increases by 3 millimeters and becomes 1+3=4 millimtres.
On the third day, there is no rain in the city, so the water level decreases by D=2 millimtres and becomes 4−2=2 millimtres.
On the fourth day, the water level increases by 2 millimtres and becomes 2+2=4 millimtres.
There will be no red alert in the city because the water level does not exceed H=6 millimtres on any of the four days.

Example case 2: The water level of the city on the 2-nd day is equal to 101 millimtres, which is greater than H=100 millimtres, 
so there will be a red alert in the city.

Example case 3: The water levels of the city on the four days are [1,3,1,3]. 
The water level is equal to H=3 millimtres on the second and fourth day, but it does not exceed the threshold.

Example case 4: There will be a red alert in the city on the 3-rd day.
