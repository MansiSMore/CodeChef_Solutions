Chef has an exam which will start exactly M minutes from now. 
However, instead of preparing for his exam, Chef started watching Season-1 of Superchef. Season-1 has N episodes, and the duration of each episode is K minutes.
Will Chef be able to finish watching Season-1 strictly before the exam starts?
Note: Please read the explanations of the sample test cases carefully.

Input Format :
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases then follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers M, N and K.

Output Format :
For each test case, output on one line YES if it is possible to finish Season-1 strictly before the exam starts, or NO if it is not possible to do so.
Output is case insensitive, which means that "yes", "Yes", "YEs", "no", "nO" - all such strings will be acceptable.

Constraints :
1≤T≤104
1≤M≤109
1≤N,K≤104
 
Sample Input 1 :
3
10 1 10
25 2 10
15 2 10

Sample Output 1 :
NO
YES
NO

Explanation :
Test Case 1: The duration of the only episode is 10 minutes, and the exam starts exactly after 10 minutes. 
So, Chef will not be able to finish watching Season-1 strictly before the exam starts.

Test Case 2: There are two episodes in Season-1, each of duration 10 minutes. 
Therefore, Chef will require 10+10=20 minutes to finish watching Season-1. 
As the exam starts after 25 minutes, Chef will be able to finish watching Season-1 strictly before the exam starts.

Test Case 3: There are two episodes in Season-1, each of duration 10 minutes. 
Therefore, Chef will require 10+10=20 minutes to finish watchin Season-1. 
As the exam starts after 15 minutes, Chef will not be able to finish watching Season-1 strictly before the exam starts.
