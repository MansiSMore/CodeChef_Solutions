What the hell are all these interactive problems? What does flushing output mean? So many questions… 
Chef explains it in an easy way: you must communicate with a grader program, which accepts your input only if you flushed the output.
There is a contest with interactive problems where N people participate. 
Each contestant has a known rating. Chef wants to know which contestants will not forget to flush the output in interactive problems. 
Fortunately, he knows that contestants with rating at least r never forget to flush their output and contestants with rating smaller than r always forget to do it. 
Help Chef!

Input :
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and r.
Each of the following N lines contains a single integer R denoting the rating of one contestant.

Output :
For each contestant, print a single line containing the string "Good boi" if this contestant does not forget to flush the output or "Bad boi" otherwise.

Constraints :
1≤N≤1,000
1,300≤r,R≤1,501

Subtasks :
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints
Example Input :
2 1500
1499
1501

Example Output :
Bad boi
Good boi
