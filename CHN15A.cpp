/*
Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious. 
Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine which mutates minions.
Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. 
The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value.
Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.
Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines.
The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement.
The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.

Output Format:
For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ K ≤ 100
All initial characteristic values lie between 1 and 105, both inclusive.
Example
Input:
1
5 10
2 4 1 35 1
Output:
1

Explanation:
After transmogrification, the characteristic values become {12,14,11,45,11}, out of which only 14 is divisible by 7. 
So only the second minion becomes Wolverine-like.
