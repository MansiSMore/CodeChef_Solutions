/*
Chef is always trying to find patterns within integers. 
Today Chef has 3 positive integers and he wonders if any one of them can be written as the sum of the other two integers.

Input:
First line will contain the number 5, which is the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, with three space-separated positive integers x, y, and z.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, "YES" if it's possible to represent any integer among the three integers as the sum of the other two integers, and "NO" if not.

NOTE: The output is case insensitive, meaning both uppercase and lowercase characters can be used at any position of the output string.

Constraints :
1<=x,y,z<=1000
Subtasks
100% points - Original constraints

Sample Input:
5
1 1 2
1 3 2
2 2 2
100 100 201
11 22 33
Sample Output:
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

Explanation:
Case 1: For this case, the third integer can be written as the sum of the first two. 2=1+1
Case 2: For this case, the second integer can be written as the sum of the first and third. 3=1+2
Case 3: For this case, no integer can be written as the sum of other two.
Case 4: For this case, no integer can be written as the sum of other two.
Case 5: For this case, the third integer can be written as the sum of the first two. 33=11+22
